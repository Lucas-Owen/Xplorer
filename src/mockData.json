It's renowned for its large mammal diversity and the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebras, and other species move in a seasonal pattern for grazing. The name 'Serengeti' comes from the Maasai language, meaning 'endless plains,' aptly describing the area's sprawling landscapes. This region is also crucial for conservation efforts and ecological studies, providing insights into the complex interactions within natural habitats.",
